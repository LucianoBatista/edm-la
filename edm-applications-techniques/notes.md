# Applications

The techniques reviewed on this paper are:

- Predicting Student Performance
- Detecting Undesirable Student Behaviors
- Grouping Students
- Student Modeling

All the applications here are on concerning students

## Predicting Student Performance

The main aim of this application is predicting the students'academic failure to improve their learning and develop the educational process.

- 2015: Predicting Students' academic performance in first year of the bachelor's in computer science. (71.3 %)
- 2016: Predict the academic perf. on two courses. (82.7 %)
- 2017: 500 students and eight attributes in secondary school. (93.6 %)
- ...

All models are reporting just the accuracy, but this can be misleading, as the accuracy is a measure of how much from the "Success" class you got right. But predicting when a student may fail is a lot more important, and for that we may need analyse another metric together.

We find out that most of the publications are related to University and Secondary School (Ensino MÃ©dio on Brazil).

The study with more data is from 2020 by Alhajami et al. and they predict the academic performance using more than 38k students (males and females) from Umm Al-Qura University for 5 years, with several attributes (School, Sex, Age, Nationality, City ...). The final algo had a performance of 84.38% accuracy.


## Detecting Undesirable Student Behaviors

## Grouping Students

## Student Modeling

Defines different aspects characterizing the student:

- cognition
- skills
- emotions
- domain knowledge
- learning strategies
- achievements
- features
- learning preferences
- affects
- evaluation
